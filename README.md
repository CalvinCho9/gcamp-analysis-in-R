Automating GCaMP Fluorescence Analysis for Neuronal Activity Quantification in Stress Response Studies
(Accepted to 2025 useR! Research Conference @ Duke University)

Calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP provides a critical window into neuronal activity, particularly in response to physiological stress. However, the large volume of imaging data presents challenges in efficient processing, normalization, and statistical analysis. This project introduces an automated R-based workflow that extracts, normalizes, and analyzes fluorescence intensity changes to identify significant neuronal responses. The pipeline standardizes intensity values against baseline fluorescence, filters for neurons exhibiting meaningful activity, and applies statistical modeling—including two-way ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons—to assess differences across experimental conditions. By integrating data processing and statistical analysis, this approach streamlines fluorescence quantification, reducing manual intervention while enhancing reproducibility. The methodology is broadly applicable across neuroscience, bioinformatics, and computational research, providing a scalable solution for analyzing calcium imaging data in diverse experimental settings.
